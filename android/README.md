A powerful Android app that creates calendar events from natural language text using AI-powered parsing.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Text Input Interface**: Type or paste event text and get structured calendar events
- **Text Selection Integration**: Select text in any app and create calendar events via context menu

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't connect to API**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you're not behind a restrictive firewall
- Try again in a few minutes (server might be starting up)

**Text selection menu doesn't show**
- Make sure you've selected actual text (not images or buttons)
- Some apps may not support the PROCESS_TEXT intent
- Try copying the text and using the main app instead

**Calendar app doesn't open**
- Make sure you have a calendar app installed (Google Calendar, Samsung Calendar, etc.)
- Check that the calendar app has necessary permissions
- Try creating an event manually in your calendar app first

**Low confidence scores**
- The text might not contain clear event information
- Try being more specific with dates and times
- Add context like "meeting", "appointment", "lunch", etc.

### Debug Information

To help with troubleshooting, the app provides:
- Confidence scores for parsed events
- Detailed error messages
- Network status indicators

## API Information

The app connects to: `https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com`

**Privacy**: 
- Text is sent to the API for processing only
- No data is stored on our servers
- All processing is stateless and temporary

**Rate Limits**:
- Reasonable usage limits apply
- If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again
