# Calendar Event Creator - iOS App

A powerful iOS app that creates calendar events from natural language text using AI-powered parsing, with full Share Extension support.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Main App Interface**: Beautiful SwiftUI interface for text input and event parsing
- **Share Extension**: Select text in any iOS app and create calendar events via Share Sheet
- **EventKit Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with iOS Calendar app
- **Real-time Parsing**: AI-powered natural language processing with confidence scoring

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **SwiftUI Interface**: Modern, native iOS design following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **Share Extension Target**: Appears in Share Sheet when text is selected in any app
- **EventKit Integration**: Direct integration with iOS Calendar for event creation
- **Robust API Integration**: Uses URLSession with proper error handling
- **Async/Await Support**: Modern Swift concurrency for smooth user experience
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and graceful degradation

## How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: The app sends your text to our AI-powered API
2. **Event Extraction**: Natural language processing extracts event details (title, date, time, location)
3. **Calendar Integration**: Opens iOS Calendar app with pre-filled event information
4. **One-Tap Creation**: Review and save the event in your iOS Calendar

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14.0 or later

### Events with Duration
- "Conference call Monday 10am for 1 hour"
- "Workshop from 9am to 5pm next Tuesday"
- "Meeting tomorrow 2pm-3pm"

### Complex Events
- "Doctor appointment on January 15th at 3:30 PM at the medical center"
- "Team standup every Monday at 9am in the main conference room"
- "Lunch meeting with Sarah at Starbucks downtown next Friday 12:30"

## Key Components

### Main App (`CalendarEventApp`)
- **ContentView**: SwiftUI interface with text input and parsing
- **EventResultView**: Displays parsed results and handles calendar integration
- **ApiService**: Handles API communication with error handling
- **Models**: Data structures for parsed events

### Share Extension (`CalendarEventExtension`)
- **ActionViewController**: Processes shared text and creates calendar events
- **ApiService**: Async API service optimized for extension context
- **EventKit Integration**: Direct calendar event creation

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

### Calendar Access
- **Purpose**: Create calendar events from parsed text
- **Usage**: EventKit framework for reading/writing calendar events
- **User Control**: Users can grant/revoke in Settings > Privacy & Security > Calendars

### Network Access
- **Purpose**: API calls to parse natural language text
- **Endpoint**: `https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com`
- **Security**: HTTPS only, no sensitive data stored

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Share Extension doesn't appear**
- Make sure you've selected text (not images or other content)
- Some apps may not support the Share Sheet for text
- Try copying the text and using the main app instead

**Calendar permission denied**
- Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Calendars
- Enable access for "Calendar Event Creator"
- Restart the app and try again

**API connection issues**
- Check your internet connection
- The app connects to: https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com
- Try again in a few minutes (server might be starting up)

**Low confidence scores**
- Be more specific with dates and times
- Add context words like "meeting", "appointment", "lunch"
- Include location information when possible

**Events not appearing in Calendar**
- Check that the Calendar app has proper permissions
- Verify your default calendar is set up correctly
- Try creating a manual event to test Calendar app functionality

### Debug Information

The app provides:
- Confidence scores for parsed events (0-100%)
- Detailed error messages for API issues
- Graceful handling of network timeouts
- Fallback behavior for parsing failures

## API Information

The app connects to: `https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com`

**Privacy**: 
- Text is sent to the API for processing only
- No data is stored on our servers
- All processing is stateless and temporary
- No personal information is collected

**Rate Limits**:
- Reasonable usage limits apply
- If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again

## Development

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **EventKit**: iOS calendar integration
- **URLSession**: Network communication
- **Async/Await**: Modern Swift concurrency
- **Share Extension**: iOS extension framework

### Key Dependencies
- iOS 15.0+ (for async/await support)
- EventKit framework (calendar integration)
- Foundation framework (networking and data)

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python tests/test_ios_complete.py
```

### Customization
You can customize:
- API endpoint in `ApiService.swift`
- UI colors and styling in SwiftUI views
- Default event duration (currently 1 hour)
- Error messages and user feedback

## Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- Text is processed temporarily for event extraction
- No user data is stored locally or remotely
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Calendar events are stored only in user's iOS Calendar

### Permissions
- Calendar access: Required for event creation
- Network access: Required for text parsing API
- No location, contacts, or other sensitive permissions required
