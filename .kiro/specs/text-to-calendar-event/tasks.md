# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up project structure and core data models








  - Create directory structure for models, services, and UI components
  - Implement core data classes (ParsedEvent, Event, ValidationResult)
  - Write unit tests for data model validation and serialization
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 5.4_

- [x] 2. Implement basic date and time parsing functionality







  - Create datetime extraction service with regex patterns for common formats
  - Implement support for absolute dates (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY)
  - Add time parsing for 12-hour and 24-hour formats with AM/PM support
  - Write comprehensive unit tests for date/time parsing edge cases
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Add relative date parsing capabilities





  - Implement relative date conversion ("tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 2 weeks")
  - Add duration parsing and end time calculation ("for 2 hours", "30 minutes")
  - Create helper functions for date arithmetic and validation
  - Write unit tests for relative date scenarios and boundary conditions
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Create event information extraction service









  - Implement title extraction using heuristics and keyword detection
  - Add location parsing with keyword identification (at, in, @)
  - Create confidence scoring system for extraction quality assessment
  - Write unit tests for various text formats and extraction scenarios
  - Verify that extract_title("Meeting at Starbucks next Friday 2pm") returns title="Meeting", location="Starbucks", date="YYYY-MM-DD 14:00".

  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Build main event parser service






  - Create unified EventParser class that integrates DateTimeParser and EventInformationExtractor
  - Implement parse_text() method that returns complete ParsedEvent objects
  - Add validation and error handling for incomplete or ambiguous text
  - Create comprehensive test suite with real-world text examples
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Create basic command-line interface for text input








  - Implement simple CLI that accepts text input and displays parsed results
  - Add command-line options for different parsing preferences (date format, etc.)
  - Create text input validation and error handling
  - Write tests for CLI functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 7. Create event preview and editing interface






  - Build console-based interface for displaying extracted event information
  - Implement interactive prompts for editing title, date, time, location, and description
  - Add validation for user input and error handling for required fields
  - Create confirmation and cancellation handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Implement calendar service and event creation





  - Create CalendarService class with interface for event management
  - Implement basic event creation that outputs to file or console (as proof of concept)
  - Add event validation and error handling before creation
  - Write unit tests for calendar service operations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Add event creation confirmation and feedback





  - Implement success confirmation with event details display
  - Add error handling and retry mechanisms for failed event creation
  - Create user feedback system for creation status and errors
  - Write tests for confirmation flow and error scenarios
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_
-

- [x] 10. Integrate all components and create main application flow











  - Create main.py application that orchestrates the complete workflow
  - Wire together CLI input, parsing, preview interface, and calendar services
  - Implement complete end-to-end workflow from text input to event creation
  - Add basic configuration options and error handling
  - Create integration tests for full user workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.4, 5.4_

- [x] 11. Add advanced parsing features and error handling





  - Enhance EventParser to handle ambiguous text with user clarification prompts
  - Add support for detecting and parsing multiple events in single text input
  - Create fallback mechanisms for failed parsing with manual input options
  - Write tests for edge cases and error recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 12. Create comprehensive test suite and validation





  - Implement end-to-end tests covering complete user workflows
  - Add performance tests for parsing large text blocks
  - Create test data sets with various text formats and scenarios
  - Validate all requirements are met through automated testing
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
