# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to highlight text containing event information and automatically create calendar events from the extracted data. The system will parse natural language text to identify key event components like dates, times, locations, and descriptions, then provide an interface to create calendar events with this information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to highlight text containing event information, so that I can quickly create calendar events without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user highlights text THEN the system SHALL display a "Create Calendar Event" option
2. WHEN a user selects the "Create Calendar Event" option THEN the system SHALL parse the highlighted text for event information
3. WHEN the system parses text THEN it SHALL extract date, time, title, and location information when present
4. WHEN event information is extracted THEN the system SHALL pre-populate a calendar event creation form

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently parse different date and time formats, so that I can create events from various text sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains dates in common formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY) THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the date
2. WHEN text contains time information (12-hour, 24-hour, with AM/PM) THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the time
3. WHEN text contains relative dates ("tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 2 weeks") THEN the system SHALL convert them to absolute dates
4. WHEN text contains duration information ("for 2 hours", "30 minutes") THEN the system SHALL calculate the end time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and edit the extracted event information before creating the calendar event, so that I can ensure accuracy and add missing details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN event information is extracted THEN the system SHALL display a preview form with all extracted data
2. WHEN the preview form is displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to edit any field (title, date, time, location, description)
3. WHEN required information is missing THEN the system SHALL highlight missing fields and prompt for input
4. WHEN the user confirms the event details THEN the system SHALL create the calendar event

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various text formats and sources, so that I can create events from emails, documents, and web pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains multiple potential events THEN the system SHALL identify and offer to create separate events
2. WHEN text is ambiguous or unclear THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions and ask for clarification
3. WHEN no event information can be extracted THEN the system SHALL inform the user and allow manual event creation
4. WHEN text contains location information THEN the system SHALL extract and include it in the event

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the created events to be saved to my calendar system, so that I can access them through my regular calendar interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calendar event is created THEN it SHALL be saved to the user's default calendar
2. WHEN an event is saved THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation with event details
3. WHEN an event creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
4. WHEN an event is created THEN it SHALL include all extracted and user-confirmed information
