# Text-to-Calendar Event User Guide

## Getting Started

The Text-to-Calendar Event system automatically creates calendar events from highlighted text. Simply select text containing event information and choose "Create Calendar Event" to get started.

### Quick Start

1. **Highlight text** containing event information (date, time, title, location)
2. **Right-click** and select "Create Calendar Event" (or use the browser extension/mobile app)
3. **Review** the extracted information in the preview
4. **Edit** any fields that need correction
5. **Confirm** to create the calendar event

## Understanding Confidence Scoring

### What Confidence Scores Mean

The system provides confidence scores to help you understand how certain it is about the extracted information:

- **üü¢ High (80-100%)**: Very confident, likely accurate
- **üü° Medium (40-79%)**: Moderately confident, please review
- **üî¥ Low (0-39%)**: Uncertain, requires your attention

### Confidence Score Examples

```
‚úÖ "Meeting on Monday, September 29th at 2:00 PM" 
   ‚Üí Confidence: 95% (explicit date and time)

‚ö†Ô∏è "Call with John next week sometime"
   ‚Üí Confidence: 45% (vague timing)

‚ùå "Important thing tomorrow"
   ‚Üí Confidence: 20% (missing details)
```

### How to Interpret Scores

#### Field-Level Confidence
Each part of your event gets its own confidence score:

- **Title**: How certain we are about the event name
- **Date/Time**: How confident we are about when it happens  
- **Location**: How sure we are about where it takes place

#### Overall Confidence
The overall score combines all fields, weighted by importance:
- Title and date/time are most important
- Location is helpful but optional
- Description adds context but doesn't affect the score much

## Optimal Text Selection and Formatting

### What Makes Good Text for Parsing

#### ‚úÖ Excellent Examples
```
"Team standup meeting on Monday, September 29th at 9:00 AM in Conference Room A"
‚Üí Has everything: clear title, specific date, exact time, precise location

"Lunch with Sarah tomorrow at 12:30 PM at Cafe Milano downtown"
‚Üí Clear purpose, relative date, specific time, named location

"Annual planning session next Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM"
‚Üí Descriptive title, clear date reference, time range
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Okay Examples (will work but may need review)
```
"Meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
‚Üí Missing: title details, location
‚Üí System will: ask you to add a better title

"Call with the team next week"
‚Üí Missing: specific day, time
‚Üí System will: ask for clarification on timing

"Lunch at the usual place on Friday"
‚Üí Missing: specific location, time
‚Üí System will: prompt for location and time details
```

#### ‚ùå Poor Examples (likely to fail or need lots of editing)
```
"Important thing soon"
‚Üí Too vague: no specific date, time, or clear purpose

"Meet me there"
‚Üí Missing: when, where, what for

"Don't forget about tomorrow"
‚Üí No event details, just a reminder
```

### Text Selection Best Practices

#### Select Complete Information
- **Include context**: Select full sentences, not just fragments
- **Get the details**: Make sure date, time, and purpose are included
- **Capture location**: Include location information when mentioned

#### Examples of Good Selection
```
Full email paragraph:
"Hi team, we're scheduling our quarterly review meeting for next Thursday, October 3rd at 2:00 PM in the main conference room. Please bring your project updates."

‚úÖ Select the whole sentence with event details
‚ùå Don't select just "quarterly review meeting"
```

#### Multi-Paragraph Selection
When event information spans multiple paragraphs, select all relevant text:

```
Email example:
"Thanks for your interest in our product demo.

We'd like to schedule a presentation for next Tuesday, September 30th at 10:00 AM. The session will be held at our downtown office at 123 Main Street.

Please let us know if this works for your schedule."

‚úÖ Select all three paragraphs for complete context
```

## Handling Ambiguous Text

### Common Ambiguity Types

#### Date Ambiguities
**Problem**: "Meeting on 3/4/2025"
- Could be March 4th or April 3rd
- **Solution**: The system will ask which format you prefer (MM/DD or DD/MM)

**Problem**: "Call next Monday"
- Could be this coming Monday or the Monday after
- **Solution**: System assumes the next occurrence; you can edit if wrong

#### Time Ambiguities  
**Problem**: "Meeting at 9"
- Could be 9 AM or 9 PM
- **Solution**: System assumes business hours (9 AM); edit if needed

**Problem**: "Lunch after the meeting"
- Depends on when the meeting is
- **Solution**: System will prompt for specific time

#### Location Ambiguities
**Problem**: "Meet at the office"
- Which office? Main office? Your office?
- **Solution**: System extracts "the office"; you can specify which one

### Resolving Ambiguities

#### When the System Asks for Clarification
The system will present options when it finds multiple valid interpretations:

```
"Meeting on 3/4/2025 at 2pm"

üìÖ Which date format?
‚óã March 4, 2025 (MM/DD/YYYY)
‚óã April 3, 2025 (DD/MM/YYYY)

üïê Which time?
‚óã 2:00 PM (afternoon)
‚óã 2:00 AM (early morning)
```

#### When You Need to Edit
For low-confidence extractions, review and edit:

```
Extracted: "Meeting" (confidence: 30%)
Your edit: "Quarterly Planning Meeting"

Extracted: "next week" (confidence: 40%)  
Your edit: "Tuesday, October 1st"
```

## System Limitations and Workarounds

### Current Limitations

#### Language Support
- **Limitation**: Currently optimized for English text
- **Workaround**: Use English keywords for dates/times when possible

#### Complex Scheduling
- **Limitation**: Doesn't handle recurring events or complex scheduling rules
- **Workaround**: Create individual events for each occurrence

#### Context Dependencies
- **Limitation**: May not understand company-specific terms or abbreviations
- **Workaround**: Use full names and standard terminology

#### Multiple Events
- **Limitation**: Works best with single events per text selection
- **Workaround**: Select text for one event at a time

### Known Issues and Workarounds

#### Issue: Time Zone Handling
**Problem**: System assumes local time zone
**Workaround**: Specify time zone in text ("2 PM EST") or edit after creation

#### Issue: All-Day Events
**Problem**: May assign specific times to all-day events
**Workaround**: Edit the event to remove times and mark as all-day

#### Issue: Recurring Events
**Problem**: Creates single occurrence only
**Workaround**: Create the first event, then set up recurrence in your calendar app

#### Issue: Very Long Text
**Problem**: Performance may slow with very large text blocks
**Workaround**: Select only the relevant paragraphs containing event information

### Working Around Limitations

#### For Better Results
1. **Be specific**: Use exact dates, times, and locations
2. **Use standard formats**: Stick to common date/time formats
3. **Include context**: Provide enough information for understanding
4. **Review results**: Always check extracted information before confirming

#### When the System Struggles
1. **Try simpler text**: Remove extra information and focus on event details
2. **Use explicit formats**: "September 29, 2025 at 2:00 PM" instead of "next week sometime"
3. **Break it down**: For complex events, provide information step by step
4. **Manual editing**: Use the edit feature to correct any mistakes

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: What types of text work best?**
A: Email invitations, calendar descriptions, meeting notes, and any text with clear date, time, and event information.

**Q: Can I use this with any calendar app?**
A: Yes, the system creates standard calendar events that work with Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, and others.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: The core parsing requires an internet connection, but once events are created, they're stored locally in your calendar.

### Parsing and Accuracy

**Q: Why is my confidence score low?**
A: Low scores usually mean the text is vague or missing key information. Try including more specific details about when and what the event is.

**Q: Can I improve the parsing accuracy?**
A: Yes! Use specific dates ("Monday, September 29th" instead of "next week"), exact times ("2:00 PM" instead of "afternoon"), and clear event titles.

**Q: What if the system gets something wrong?**
A: You can edit any field before creating the event. The system is designed to be a starting point that you can refine.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the confidence scoring work?**
A: The system analyzes how explicit and unambiguous your text is. Specific dates and times get higher scores than vague references.

**Q: Why does processing sometimes take a few seconds?**
A: The system uses advanced AI to understand natural language, which requires some processing time for accuracy.

**Q: Can I batch process multiple events?**
A: Currently, the system works best with one event at a time. For multiple events, select and process each one separately.

### Privacy and Security

**Q: Is my text data stored or shared?**
A: Text is processed locally when possible. Check your specific implementation's privacy policy for details.

**Q: Can I use this for sensitive information?**
A: The system is designed for general calendar events. For highly sensitive information, review your organization's data handling policies.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: What if no event information is found?**
A: Try selecting more text with clearer event details, or use more explicit language about dates, times, and event purposes.

**Q: The location is wrong or missing. What should I do?**
A: Edit the location field manually, or try selecting text that includes clearer location indicators like "at [place]" or "in [room]".

**Q: Can I save my preferences for date formats?**
A: Yes, most implementations allow you to set preferences for date format (MM/DD vs DD/MM), time format (12-hour vs 24-hour), and default duration.
